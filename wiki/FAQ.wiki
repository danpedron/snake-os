*Q1: Where is the firmware /binary ?  *

  Answer: 

  Use download section.   snakeos-V1.0.0-20091027-from-original.zip

  or http://groups.google.com/group/dealextreme-nas-/web/snake-os---v1-0-0
  Download the *from original* 


*Q2: Can I upgrade my NS-K330 or WLX-652 with SnakeOS ?*

  Answer: Yes. Definitly. Recommended. More stable, and more functions.

*Q: Where is user documentation?*

  Answer1:  Douglas not even made this firmware but documented it! 

  Authors are: Douglas Gazineu,  Jarko, JosÃ© Maciel,  Miguel Moreto

  You can read it in download section.


*Q: Device lost all connectivity, no answer for ping, ssh, http, ftp. What can I do?*

  Answer1:  Reset it.

  NS-K330 has a reset button. Push it while powering on, with the reset button
  held in for 45 seconds (counted to 60 just in case).
  After it showed up under the default IP (or at least the one assigned by the
  DHCP server), by the MAC address.  

*Q: Reset was not enough - device not respond.*

  Answer2: If you are not lucky with reset, second chance you are able to serial connect to device and telnet via the RS232-TTL converter direct connect.

*Q: Serial connect was not allowed - device not respond/boot.*

  Answer3: If you not enough lucky with serial connection either, third chance to write 
  and replace Flash. Flash contains the boot, and root partitions. 
  (BIOS and Operation system together.)

  1. flash write,

*Q: Default user and password for the web interface ?*

  Answer: admin/snake 

*Q: Hey guys it is great, How can I compile my own one?*

  Short answer:
  # Download source, 
  # Extract tar -xvjf  snake-os-sdk_0.9.tar.bz2
  # cd kernel folder
  # make menuconfig.
  # make

  But it will compile zimage only, which is not enough to boot in the NAS, only to check are the binaries and modules compiled either for ARM.

  Douglas made a script which compile the kernel and make root file system for JFFS, compress the binaries with UPX (which makes on the fly decompiled binary)

  But this script uses kernel konfigs based on *"/images/snake-os-sdk_0.9/configs".*

  Steps:
  # Extract tar -xvjf  snake-os-sdk_0.9.tar.bz2
  # Install upx-nrv, jffs and all the packages reported missing during compile.
  # (apt-get install upx-nrv).
  # export PATH to point to arm compiler. 
    export PATH=/images/snake-os-sdk_0.9/tools/arm-uclibc-3.4.6/bin:$PATH 
  # Execute ./mk_snakeos_image.sh *twice!* For some reason run it *two times*.(2x)

  It will create writable firmware on
  /images/snake-os-sdk_0.9/snake_os/release/ and tftp-capable image on /images/snake-os-sdk_0.9/output

  If you change something on your kernel options, run "make clean" on your kernel dir again and start over the steps above:

  # Go to kernel folder, run "make clean"
  # Go to /images/snake-os-sdk_0.9/ folder, run "make clean".
 

*Q: Write permissions problem. *

  I have activated samba and FTP. In FTP with anonymous acces and read & write permssion.
 
  Through samba i can read and write but by FTP i can only read. I haven't got write permissions even though I have configured it in Snake OS.
 
  Answer:

  Besides enabling ftp, you will have to adjust the `*`nix permissions if using an ext2/ext3 drive. This can be done by using ssh to access the NAS.
 
  Tip: If you want only to rely on ftp users, use the command 

  `chmod 777/usb/PATH-TO-FOLDER`

*Q How to copy files from one mounted partition to another mounted partition?*
  Answer: 
  Connect with SSH and run the command below. It will copy the files of source_folder to dest_folder and log the output to log.txt (place outside the involved folders). 

  `nohup cp -av /usb/diska/source_folder  /usb/diskb/dest_folder > /usb/diska/log.txt `

  This way, you can even disconnect the SSH client and the transfer will continue.
