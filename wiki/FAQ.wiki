*Q1:* Where is the firmware /binary ?  

  * Answer*: http://groups.google.com/group/dealextreme-nas-/web/snake-os---v1-0-0

*Q2:* Can I upgrade my NS-K330 or WLX-652 with SnakeOS ?

  *Answer1:* Yes. Definitly. Recommended. More stable, and more functions.

*Q2:* Device lost all connectivity, no answer for ping, ssh, http, ftp. What can I do?

*Answer1:*  
  Reset it.

  NS-K330 has a reset button. Push it while powering on, with the reset button
  held in for 45 seconds (counted to 60 just in case).
  After it showed up under the default IP (or at least the one assigned by the
  DHCP server), by the MAC address.  

*Q.:* Reset was not enough - device not respond.
*Answer2:* If you are not lucky with reset, second chance you are able to serial connect to device and telnet via the rs452 direct connect.
