  Reset it.

  NS-K330 has a reset button. Push it while powering on, with the reset button
  held in for 45 seconds (counted to 60 just in case).
  After it showed up under the default IP (or at least the one assigned by the
  DHCP server), by the MAC address.

*Q: I have activated samba and FTP. In FTP with anonymous acces and read & write
permssion.*
 
Through samba i can read and write but by FTP i can only read. I haven't got
write permissions even though I have configured it in Snake OS.
 
*Answer:* 

Besides enabling ftp, you will have to adjust the `*`nix permissions if using
an ext2/ext3 drive. This can be done by using ssh to access the NAS.
 
Tip: If you want only to rely on ftp users, use the command 
`chmod 777/usb/PATH-TO-FOLDER`
