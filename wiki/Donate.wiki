    * Suggest fixes by sending in patches
    * Improve the code
    * Help with unit and end-to-end testing
    * Provide peer support on mailing lists, forums or newsgroups
    * Publish an article on your blog (send the link) or elsewhere (e.g., community sites) to educate others regarding some aspect of the project
    * Help with missing documentation
