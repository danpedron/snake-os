Howto Debian environment within SnakeOs.
Written by Robert Szabo.

= Introduction =

Very simple way to have Debian (and its huge number of packages). 
Chroot is a shell (embedded system within a linux) where you have debian libraries, and environment within SnakeOS host.)

You only need to have an USB device attached. (No serial connection needed.)

*UPDATE! 2010.08.23. A newest updated chrooted Debian package - created by Pinguino7  - is available, I recommend it.  :) *

= Details =

  # ssh to NAS - or putty from win 
  # `#`cd /usb/sda1
  # Download chroot debian with wget:
  # `#` wget http://snake-os.googlecode.com/files/debian.tgz
  # `#`tar -xvf debian.tgz    
  # `#`mount -o bind /proc /usb/sda1/debian/proc 
  # `#`mount -o bind /dev /usb/sda1/debian/dev 
  # `#`mount -o bind /usb/sda1 /usb/sda1/debian/mnt/sda1    - this is not mandatory
    
  # `#`chroot /usb/sda1/debian/ 

Now you are in chrooted debian shell.

   To exit debian use "exit" command or reboot. 

*Some useful - "must have"  thing: *


  * to have tons of debian packages use APT:) 
  * apt-get install packagename       

  * mc  - Midnight Commander - feature full file commander. Just run: mc
  * plowdown <--- downloading from hosting servicees like rapdishare and megaupload ( from http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/downloads/list. apt-get install plowdown.
  * screen <--- It allows you to run "virtual terminals" with the added benefit that closing the connection the process keep running, so no need to do 10 ssh sessions, or using nohup.  apt-get install screen.

  * edit /etc/resolv.conf if you need.

  * Mount dev and proc, you can use fstab if yo whish.
