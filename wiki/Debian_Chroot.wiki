Howto Debian environment within SnakeOs.

= Introduction =

Very simple way to have Debian and its huge number of packages. 
(chroot is shell (a kind of sandbox) where you have debian libraries, and environment within SnakeOS host.)

You only need to have an USB device attached. (No serial connection needed.)

= Details =

  # ssh to NAS - or putty from win 
  # `#`cd /usb/sda1
  # Download chroot debian
  `#` wget http://snake-os.googlecode.com/files/debian.tar.gz
  # `#`tar -xvf debian.tar.gz    
  # `#`tar -xvf debian.tar
  # `#`mount -o bind /proc /usb/sda1/debian/proc 
  # `#`mount -o bind /dev /usb/sda1/debian/dev 
    
  # `#`chroot /usb/sda1/debian/ 

Now you are in chrooted debian shell.

   To exit debian use "exit" command or reboot. 

*Some useful thing:*

  * mkdir /mnt/sda1
  * mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1

  * mc

    to have tons of debian packages use APT:) 
  * apt-get install packagename       

  * edit /etc/resolv.conf if you need.

  * Mount dev and proc, you can use fstab if yo whish.
