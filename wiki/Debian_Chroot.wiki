Howto Debian environment within SnakeOs.

= Introduction =

Very simple way to have Debian and its huge number of packages. 
(chroot is a kind of sandbox where you have debian libraries, and environment within SnakeOS host.)

= Details =

  # SSH to NAS - SnakeOs 
  # cd /usb/sda1
  # wget http://snake-os.googlecode.com/files/debian.tar.gz
  # tar -xvf debian.tar.gz    
  # tar -xvf debian.tar
  # Mount dev and proc, you can use fstab if yo whish: 
    mount -o bind /proc /usb/sda1/debian/proc 
    mount -o bind /dev /usb/sda1/debian/dev 
  # Run chrooted sh 
    chroot /usb/sda1/debian/ 
  To exit debian use "exit" command or reboot. 

  # to have tons of debian packages use APT:) 
    edit /etc/resolv.conf if you need.
  # apt-get install mc    (  it is already installed.:)    
  # mkdir /mnt/sda1
  # mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1
