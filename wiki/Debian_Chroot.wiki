Howto Debian environment within SnakeOs.

= Introduction =

Very simple way to have Debian and its huge number of packages. 
(chroot is a kind of sandbox where you have debian libraries, and environment within SnakeOS host.)

= Details =

  # Download from here http://code.google.com/p/snake-os/downloads/list
  # SSH to SnakeOs. 
    mkdir /usb/sda1/debian
    cd /usb/sda1/debian
    copy debian.tar.bz2 to /usb/sda1/debian via share or ftp.
    bunzip debian-etch-base.tar.bz2
    tar -xvf debian-etch-base.tar    /exctract files./
  # Mount dev and proc, you can use fstab if yo whish: 
    mount -o bind /proc /usb/sda1/debian/proc 
    mount -o bind /dev /usb/sda1/debian/dev 
  # Run chrooted sh 
    chroot /usb/sda1/debian/. 
  To exit debian use "exit" command or reboot. 

  # to have tons of debian packages use APT:) 
    edit /etc/resolv.conf if you need.
  # apt-get install mc.
  # mkdir /mnt/sda1
  # mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1
