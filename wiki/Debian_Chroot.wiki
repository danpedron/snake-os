Howto Debian environment within SnakeOs.

= Introduction =

Very simple way to have Debian and its huge number of packages. 
(chroot is shell (a kind of sandbox) where you have debian libraries, and environment within SnakeOS host.)

You only need to have an USB device attached. (No serial connection needed.)

= Details =

  # ssh to NAS - or putty from win 
  # `#`cd /usb/sda1
  # Download chroot debian with wget:
  `#` wget http://snake-os.googlecode.com/files/debian.tgz
  # `#`tar -xvf debian.tgz    
  # `#`mount -o bind /proc /usb/sda1/debian/proc 
  # `#`mount -o bind /dev /usb/sda1/debian/dev 
    
  # `#`chroot /usb/sda1/debian/ 

Now you are in chrooted debian shell.

   To exit debian use "exit" command or reboot. 

*Some useful - "must have"  thing: *

  * Mount USB HDD within Chrooted debian: 
    mkdir /mnt/sda1; mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1

  * to have tons of debian packages use APT:) 
  * apt-get install packagename       

  * mc
  * plowdown <--- downloading from hosting servicees like rapdishare and megaupload ( from http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/downloads/list 
  * screen <--- It allows you to run "virtual terminals" with the added benefit that closing the connection the process keep running, so no need to do 10 ssh sessions, or using nohup

  * edit /etc/resolv.conf if you need.

  * Mount dev and proc, you can use fstab if yo whish.
