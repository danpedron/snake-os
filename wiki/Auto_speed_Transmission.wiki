= Details =

Hi ,

1. My crontab

*/10 * * * * sh /usb/hd1/scripts/checaComputadores.sh

the script runs every 10 minutes.

2. The file is attached

3. I think this translation is better

found=0;
computers=/usb/hd1/scripts/computers.txt;

for ip in `cat $computers`; do ping -c 1 $ip>/dev/null; [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "$ip UP" && found=1 && break || echo "$ip DOWN" ; done

if [ $found -eq 1 ] 
then
    echo "Transmission speed down" >> /var/messages;
    /usb/hd1/transmission-remote localhost:9091 -n admin:pass -d 10 -u 10

else
       echo "Transmission speed up" >> /var/messages
       /usb/hd1/transmission-remote localhost:9091 -n admin:pass -D -U
fi;

4. The correct setting is in red in the above script

Please, if you publish the script do not forget to mention my name as creator.
